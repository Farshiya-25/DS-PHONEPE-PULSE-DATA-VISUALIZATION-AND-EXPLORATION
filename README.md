# DS-PHONEPE-PULSE-DATA-VISUALIZATION-AND-EXPLORATION

# A User Friendly Tool using Streamlit and Plotly

The Technologies that are used in this project are:
1.Github Cloning
2.Python
3.Pandas
4.MySql
5.Streamlit
6.Plotly

The steps that are done here are:
1) Data extraction:
       Atfirst, cloned the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the phonepe pulse github repository and stored it in a suitable format such as JSON.
2) Data tranformation:
       Using Python scripting, Pandas to manipulate and pre-process the fetched data which includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
3) Database insertion:
       Using the mysql-connector-python library in python to connect to a SQL database and inserted the transformed data using sql queries.
4) Dasboard creation:
       Using the Streamlit and Plotly libraries created an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo visualization maps are used to display the data on a map. Using the data in sql tables, updated the dashboard dynamically.
